Each 1 mL (≈ ⅕ tsp) delivers **≥20 billion CFU**. *High* concentrate. Take very, very little: 1/2 - 2 tsp. Drinking too much might lead to bloating, mild nausea, etc. While theoretically it's a big supply, colonies can degrade—recommend restocking every week or so. 

* Keep refrigerated 34–38 °F (1–3 °C).  
* Best within 14 days of the “Brewed” date on the cap.  
* Ages 3–12: start with 0.25 mL (5 B CFU).  
* Under 3 yr, pregnant, or immune-compromised individuals should consult a pediatrician or clinician before use.

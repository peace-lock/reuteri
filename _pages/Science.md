> In humans, **the abundance of L. reuteri has decreased in recent decades**, most likely due to modern lifestyles (e.g., antibiotic use and the Western diet). Over the same time span, there has been an increase in the incidence of inflammatory disorders. This review strongly suggests that L. reuteri and its metabolites promote human health through diverse mechanisms. In Table 1, we have listed the probiotic strains mentioned in this paper and their effects. They are effective in decreasing obesity parameters, improving insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, modulating gut integrity, improving inflammation, attenuating hepatic disorders and help to improve the dysbiosis of CF patients.

> Third, **bearing the ability to strengthen the intestinal barrier**, the colonization of L. reuteri may decrease the microbial translocation from the gut lumen to the tissues. Microbial translocation across the intestinal epithelium has been hypothesized as an initiator of inflammation. Therefore, inflammatory diseases, including those located in the gut as well as in remote tissues, may be ameliorated by increasing the colonization of L. reuteri. Notably, the decrease in the abundance of L. reuteri in humans in the past decades is correlated with an increase in the incidences of inflammatory diseases over the same period of time. **Direct supplementation or prebiotic modulation of L. reuteri may be an attractive preventive and/or therapeutic avenue against inflammatory diseases.**

> In human fecal fermentation, L. reuteri remodeled the microbiota by decreasing the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Escherichiaâ€“Shigella, and Desulfovibrio and increasing the relative abundances of Phascolarctobacterium, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus. Moreover, L. reuteri biofilms played more positive roles in microbiota modulation and short-chain fatty acid production than planktonic L. reuteri. These findings provide an understanding of the beneficial effects of probiotic biofilms, laying a foundation for the application of probiotic biofilms as a health promoter.

> Mixed probiotics containing L. reuteri ameliorated depressive symptoms in patients and depression-like behaviors in animals. Combined microbiota seems to be more effective than single strain intervention in the treatment of depression. Patients with depressive symptoms, other clinical populations, age < 60 years, female patients may benefit more from probiotics. L. reuteri alone did not improve depressive symptoms.

> The present meta-analysis demonstrated that supplementation with L. reuteri was beneficial for improving the eradication rate of H. pylori, reducing the overall incidence of side effects, and relieving gastrointestinal symptoms in patients during treatment. The findings provide new insights into clinical decision-making.

> Reuterin produced by L. reuteri is a potent anti-microbial compound capable of inhibiting a wide spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms. Apart from antimicrobial metabolite production, L. reuteri creates biofilms that stimulate tumor necrosis factor production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- activated monocytoid cells. Interestingly, L. reuteri administration has emerged as a potential therapy for childhood functional gastrointestinal disturbances as these disturbances are associated with gut microbiota perturbations in early life. The current review summarizes the beneficial aspects of the probiotic L. reuteri strain in clinical practice with a special focus on its role in improving gut health and immunity in infants and toddlers.

> In conclusion, L. reuteri plays a key role in maintaining a balanced microbiota gut composition. Many clinical trials have proved the safety, efficacy and tolerance of this probiotic in preventing and treating numerous gastrointestinal disorders, ranging from diarrhea to constipation. In our opinion, L. reuteri meets all the requirements to contribute to beneficial effects on human-gut health in the emergency setting. In fact, gastrointestinal disorders, as stated previously, are one of the most common causes of admission to the ED. The use of L. reuteri, directly in the emergency room can speed up the remission of symptoms, reduce the recovery period, and promote the safe discharge of patients.

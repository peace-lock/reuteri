## Why L. reuteri?

Emerging research links imbalances in the gut microbiome—often called gut dysbiosis—to a spectrum of problems with effects, well, basically all over the human body. Dysbiosis can harm gastrointestinal, metabolic, skin, cognitive, and even mental health. Curing it is a difficult process, but careful supplementation can make it faster. **L. reuteri** (Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938), due to its natural presence in some healthy humans and its wide variety of health benefits, is a natural choice. Furthermore, in healthy adults, it can strengthen existing wellness and even provide novel mental effects (increased oxytocin, vivid dreams). 

🫙 L. reuteri, generally speaking:
* Naturally colonizes human gut and urogenital tract (but can also benefit skin, oral, and other microbiomes)
* Produces **reuterin**, a natural antimicrobial that suppresses pathogens
* Provides overall health benefits in both human and animal studies

🌿 Potential benefits include:
* Gut comfort & regularity  
* Better immune balance (fewer colds, less inflammation)  
* Outcompeting pathogens (H. pylori, for example) [<1>](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17562848241258021)
* Skin appearance (↓ acne, ↑ dermal collagen)  
* Mood & stress resilience (↑ oxytocin, ↓ cortisol in some studies)  
* Alleviating depression [<2>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0163834325001069)
* Metabolic support (better insulin sensitivity, lower LDL)  
* Bone strength (↑ bone density markers)  
* Oral health (cuts down plaque & gum bleeding)  
* Women’s & men’s health (↑ vaginal microbiome health; ↑ testosterone in animal work)

#### *Why not just buy it from Amazon / Why the ferment?*

Standard capsules dose at about 100 million CFUs. My fermentation process ensures *at least* 10-20 billion CFU per mL (but likely more). Additionally, 1. the bacteria is healthier as they've been already woken up, and 2. comes with *reuterin* (usually only produced after a while in the gut, but pre-made in the fermentation process). Overall, it's a lot more effective.

**With retail, you pay $29.99 for 60 billion CFU. With my ferment, you pay $8 for 1.2 trillion CFU.**

#### *How do you make it?*

I use 🥕 carrot juice (main substrate), grape juice (rich in polyphenols; feeds reuteri), and baking soda (to provide a comfortable pH). I also add nutritional yeast, glycerin, and some sugar to feed it. My starting culture is BioGaia's [Protectis Immune Active Probiotic](https://www.amazon.com/BioGaia-Protectis-Probiotic-Clinically-Probiotics/dp/B09H3Q9GJV/ref=asc_df_B09H3Q9GJV?mcid=f7346a92347836aebb20dee0bb7331d3&hvocijid=10943040370973686845-B09H3Q9GJV-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10943040370973686845&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028313&hvtargid=pla-2281435179778&psc=1). Juices are not organic, but glad to make organic batches on request.

It's not too hard to make. I'll provide detailed instructions around August 22nd. 

#### *Is it safe?*

Our batches are heat-treated before fermentation, produced under >pH 4.5 control, and immediately chilled to 34 – 38 °F. At-home ferments always contain some amount of wild bacteria (there's always an extremely minor risk of illness, especially if your immune system is struggling), but previous 16s DNA testing has shown ferments contain over 90% L. reuteri. If a bottle ever seems off, let me know. 

#### *Is this a miracle product?*

No. Human bodies are complex and there are many theories as to the best ways to take care of them. L. reuteri, however (especially in this concentrated form), is one of the most promising probiotics for overall health, so you might see better results from it than from a more specific supplement. 

#### *How can I help?*

Share with friends! I'd like to sell a lot before I'm gone, but I don't think many people are aware of L. reuteri.

## Usage

Each 1 mL (≈ ⅕ tsp) delivers **≥20 billion CFU**. *High* concentrate. Take very, very little: 1/2 - 2 tsp. Drinking too much might lead to bloating, mild nausea, etc. While theoretically it's a big supply, colonies can degrade—recommend restocking every week or so. 

* Keep refrigerated 34–38 °F (1–3 °C).  
* Best within 14 days of the “Brewed” date on the cap.  
* Ages 3–12: start with 0.25 mL (5 B CFU).  
* Under 3 yr, pregnant, or immune-compromised individuals should consult a pediatrician or clinician before use.

## Science


> In humans, **the abundance of L. reuteri has decreased in recent decades**, most likely due to modern lifestyles (e.g., antibiotic use and the Western diet). Over the same time span, there has been an increase in the incidence of inflammatory disorders. This review strongly suggests that L. reuteri and its metabolites promote human health through diverse mechanisms. In Table 1, we have listed the probiotic strains mentioned in this paper and their effects. They are effective in decreasing obesity parameters, improving insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, modulating gut integrity, improving inflammation, attenuating hepatic disorders and help to improve the dysbiosis of CF patients.

> Third, **bearing the ability to strengthen the intestinal barrier**, the colonization of L. reuteri may decrease the microbial translocation from the gut lumen to the tissues. Microbial translocation across the intestinal epithelium has been hypothesized as an initiator of inflammation. Therefore, inflammatory diseases, including those located in the gut as well as in remote tissues, may be ameliorated by increasing the colonization of L. reuteri. Notably, the decrease in the abundance of L. reuteri in humans in the past decades is correlated with an increase in the incidences of inflammatory diseases over the same period of time. **Direct supplementation or prebiotic modulation of L. reuteri may be an attractive preventive and/or therapeutic avenue against inflammatory diseases.**

> In human fecal fermentation, L. reuteri remodeled the microbiota by decreasing the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Escherichia–Shigella, and Desulfovibrio and increasing the relative abundances of Phascolarctobacterium, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus. Moreover, L. reuteri biofilms played more positive roles in microbiota modulation and short-chain fatty acid production than planktonic L. reuteri. These findings provide an understanding of the beneficial effects of probiotic biofilms, laying a foundation for the application of probiotic biofilms as a health promoter.

> Mixed probiotics containing L. reuteri ameliorated depressive symptoms in patients and depression-like behaviors in animals. Combined microbiota seems to be more effective than single strain intervention in the treatment of depression. Patients with depressive symptoms, other clinical populations, age < 60 years, female patients may benefit more from probiotics. L. reuteri alone did not improve depressive symptoms.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0163834325001069

> The present meta-analysis demonstrated that supplementation with L. reuteri was beneficial for improving the eradication rate of H. pylori, reducing the overall incidence of side effects, and relieving gastrointestinal symptoms in patients during treatment. The findings provide new insights into clinical decision-making.

> Reuterin produced by L. reuteri is a potent anti-microbial compound capable of inhibiting a wide spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms. Apart from antimicrobial metabolite production, L. reuteri creates biofilms that stimulate tumor necrosis factor production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- activated monocytoid cells. Interestingly, L. reuteri administration has emerged as a potential therapy for childhood functional gastrointestinal disturbances as these disturbances are associated with gut microbiota perturbations in early life. The current review summarizes the beneficial aspects of the probiotic L. reuteri strain in clinical practice with a special focus on its role in improving gut health and immunity in infants and toddlers.

> In conclusion, L. reuteri plays a key role in maintaining a balanced microbiota gut composition. Many clinical trials have proved the safety, efficacy and tolerance of this probiotic in preventing and treating numerous gastrointestinal disorders, ranging from diarrhea to constipation. In our opinion, L. reuteri meets all the requirements to contribute to beneficial effects on human-gut health in the emergency setting. In fact, gastrointestinal disorders, as stated previously, are one of the most common causes of admission to the ED. The use of L. reuteri, directly in the emergency room can speed up the remission of symptoms, reduce the recovery period, and promote the safe discharge of patients.

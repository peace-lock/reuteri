Hello. Welcome to my page. You can find explanations on L. reuteri and its benefits here. Unfortunately, I'm moving soon, so batches will only be available until **August 22nd**. I'll publicize fermentation instructions then so you can make it at home for free. [Buy here →](#applying)

## Why L. reuteri?

Emerging research links imbalances in the gut microbiome—often called gut dysbiosis—to a spectrum of problems with effects, well, basically all over the human body. Dysbiosis can harm gastrointestinal, metabolic, skin, cognitive, and even mental health. Curing it is a difficult process, but careful supplementation can make it faster. **L. reuteri** (Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938), due to its natural presence in some healthy humans and its wide variety of health benefits, is a natural choice. Furthermore, in healthy adults, it can strengthen existing wellness and even provide novel mental effects (increased oxytocin, vivid dreams). 

🫙 L. reuteri, generally speaking:
* Naturally colonizes human gut and urogenital tract (but can also benefit skin, oral, and other microbiomes)
* Produces **reuterin**, a natural antimicrobial that suppresses pathogens
* Provides overall health benefits in both human and animal studies

🌿 Potential benefits include:
* Gut comfort & regularity  
* Better immune balance (fewer colds, less inflammation)  
* Outcompeting pathogens (H. pylori, for example) [<1>](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17562848241258021)
* Skin appearance (↓ acne, ↑ dermal collagen)  
* Mood & stress resilience (↑ oxytocin, ↓ cortisol in some studies)  
* Alleviating depression [<2>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0163834325001069)
* Metabolic support (better insulin sensitivity, lower LDL)  
* Bone strength (↑ bone density markers)  
* Oral health (cuts down plaque & gum bleeding)  
* Women’s & men’s health (↑ vaginal microbiome health; ↑ testosterone in animal work)

#### *Why not just buy it from Amazon / Why the ferment?*

Standard capsules dose at about 100 million CFUs. My fermentation process ensures *at least* 10-20 billion CFU per mL (but likely more). Additionally, 1. the bacteria is healthier as they've been already woken up, and 2. comes with *reuterin* (usually only produced after a while in the gut, but pre-made in the fermentation process). Overall, it's a lot more effective.

**With retail, you pay $29.99 for 60 billion CFU. With my ferment, you pay $8 for 1.2 trillion CFU.**

#### *How do you make it?*

I use 🥕 carrot juice (main substrate), grape juice (rich in polyphenols; feeds reuteri), and baking soda (to provide a comfortable pH). I also add nutritional yeast, glycerin, and some sugar to feed it. My starting culture is BioGaia's [Protectis Immune Active Probiotic](https://www.amazon.com/BioGaia-Protectis-Probiotic-Clinically-Probiotics/dp/B09H3Q9GJV/ref=asc_df_B09H3Q9GJV?mcid=f7346a92347836aebb20dee0bb7331d3&hvocijid=10943040370973686845-B09H3Q9GJV-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10943040370973686845&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028313&hvtargid=pla-2281435179778&psc=1). Juices are not organic, but glad to make organic batches on request.

It's not too hard to make. I'll provide detailed instructions around August 22nd. 

#### *Is it safe?*

Our batches are heat-treated before fermentation, produced under >pH 4.5 control, and immediately chilled to 34 – 38 °F. At-home ferments always contain some amount of wild bacteria (there's always an extremely minor risk of illness, especially if your immune system is struggling), but previous 16s DNA testing has shown ferments contain over 90% L. reuteri. If a bottle ever seems off, let me know. 

#### *Is this a miracle product?*

No. Human bodies are complex and there are many theories as to the best ways to take care of them. L. reuteri, however (especially in this concentrated form), is one of the most promising probiotics for overall health, so you might see better results from it than from a more specific supplement. 

#### *How can I help?*

Share with friends! I'd like to sell a lot before I'm gone, but I don't think many people are aware of L. reuteri.

## Buy

Order on this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/qgLmnCUSBREkMfQp8).

**Price:** *6$* (5$ + 1$ bottle deposit) for first batch.

## Usage

Each 1 mL (≈ ⅕ tsp) delivers **≥20 billion CFU**. *High* concentrate. Take very, very little: 1/2 - 2 tsp. Drinking too much might lead to bloating, mild nausea, etc. While theoretically it's a big supply, colonies can degrade—recommend restocking every week or so. 

* Keep refrigerated 34–38 °F (1–3 °C).  
* Best within 14 days of the “Brewed” date on the cap.  
* Ages 3–12: start with 0.25 mL (5 B CFU).  
* Under 3 yr, pregnant, or immune-compromised individuals should consult a pediatrician or clinician before use.
